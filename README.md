### Introduction:###
  The Corona pandemic has led to a worldwide increase in mental health disorders. At the same time, there is a shortage of psychiatrists and psychotherapists, and the waiting time for a therapy is to high. Internet-based innovations are already being used to counteract the shortage of specialists and support those affected. Studies confirm the effectiveness of digital mental health applications in various mental health disorders. However, after further research, we have noticed that while there are plenty of applications on the market, they usually focus on specific solutions for individual diseases or symptoms. An integrated platform could increase access to help for those seeking it and improve the usability of the results for treating professionals. This idea will be explored in more detail and a product concept will be developed.
